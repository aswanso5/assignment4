    <p>Abby Swanson grew up in a very small town in Upstate New York. Her mother influenced her passion for music at a very young age as she was her music teacher in elementary school. Abby started singing at a very young age and performing in her school musicals. A few years later she began studying dance, piano, and voice. Abby is currently studying at Nazareth College towards a BFA in Musical Theatre with a minor in the Entertainment/Recording Industry. When not performing she loves spending time with her family and playing with her dog, Peanut. </p>
